# aurora-code-blue
"Aurora: Code Blue" style for Better and Enhanced Discord.

This is a modified version of the Aurora theme for Better Discord. It is compatible with Enhanced Discord, where I strongly prefer using the latter instead of BD. Changes:
  - Accent colors are now dark & electric blue
  - The backdrop was changed to a dev-related wallpaper
